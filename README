HW 1 (imgview)

Description:
imgview is a command line image viewing utility. This project offers a few features:

If no command line arguments are passed to imgview, the program will open a black window.
Providing a filename as an argument will make imgview open that file on startup.
When the window is open, the user can input the following commands:

    r: read an image into the program to be displayed. Prompts user for a filename
    w: write the currently displayed image to a file. Prompts user for a filename
    1: display only the red channel
    2: display only the green channel
    3: display only the blue channel
    o: display all channels
    q or ESC: quit

The image will be displayed at the center of the window, and scale appropriately if the
window size is less than the image size.

Usage:
    // No command line arguments, goes straight to interactive mode
    ./imgview

    // Command line argument, provide filename of image to be opened
    ./imgview <IMAGE.PNG>

Some extra notes:
    All images are converted to RGBA color space upon being read into imgview.
    When writing to file, the currently selected channel(s) will be saved to file. 
    The size of the window does not affect the image when it is saved to file.
